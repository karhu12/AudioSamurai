# Audio Samurai

Audio samurai is an Unity project focused on learning about Audio Processing and general game development using unity.
The quirk of the game that we have planned is being able to play your own songs and beat the enemies in rhythm.

## Project Planning
Project is planned using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/59yEvth0/audio-samurai). Request access if you do not have it.

## Development Requirements
Developing with this repository requires you to have certain prequisites set.
* [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) needs to be installed in order to keep track of the large assets easier.
